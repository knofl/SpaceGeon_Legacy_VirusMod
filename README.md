# SpaceGeon_VirusMod
This is the Virus Mod Source Code for SpaceGeon game (https://store.steampowered.com/app/1212380/SpaceGeon/)
You can freely use it and modificate according with the MIT licence
Though, the mod is open and free, you'll need to buy the base game to actualy be able to build it.
The source needs BasicAssembly.dll from the base game to be put in the Assets\Plugin directory.
You can develope your own mode, based on this one. More documentation is available on Steam: https://steamcommunity.com/app/1212380/guides/
Later I'll create repo build only from documentation, until then, you're on your own in the journey of the mod development.

In this modification I used several Open asset packs:
* Hero and his shotgun from "Eragoth's tiny 2D platform shooter"[eragoth.itch.io]
